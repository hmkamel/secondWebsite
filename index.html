    <h3>Hello World!</h3>
    <p> The purpose of this website is to document my journey in learning about Web Development as well as serve as
        practice as I learn.
        Also it'll be interesting to see how much I've developed as a aspiring web developer.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It is important to keep your lines of code structured in order for it to be more legible.</li>
        <li>Such as to have everything included in your head & body to be indented.</li>
        <li>Best practices is to replace <i>italics</i> with <em>emphasis</em> as well as replace <b>bold</b> with
            <strong>strong.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Using <em><strong>alt</strong></em> after inserting an image URL can be good for search enging optimization
            because Google uses alt texts to find out what a webpage is all about.</li>
        <li>Anchors can be used as <strong><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/such">such</a></strong>.
        </li>
        <li>When creating Forms on HTML I would not recommend to put it into a table format.</li>
        <li>Browser have a default value for css & html elements. If your css style isn't functioning as intented try
            seeing what its default value is.</li>
        <li>
            You can create classes amongest your elements and use .class caller in the external css files to individualy
            manipulate them. Also you can have multiple classes per element.
        </li>
        <li>You can create ids as well as classes with id="" and call that in the css external styler with #. However
            with id's they are unique and can only be used on one single element</li>
        <li>Elements are or boxes are shaped by the following: its dimension, its border dimensions, its padding (space
            between the box element and the border), and margin dimensions(how far away are two elements from each
            other)</li>
        <li>CSS Display properties: have something called block elements where they block any elements from being next
            to them either to the right or left they are; paragraphs, headers, divisions, lists, and forms.</li>
        <li>
            Span can be used with paragraphs to just edit a few letters of the whole paragraphs and they are also knows
            as inline display elements.</li>
        <li>You can change the display properties of elements from block to inline or even a mix of both as inline-block
        </li>
        <li>Positioning can be a property that can be changed - like using position: relative; where you can move the
            element however many pixels you want from its natural position</li>
        <li>Divs from what I understand so far are used to position elements where you want them to be in a page. Those
            elements positions can be changed relative to those divs or can be fixed in place using "fixed" to persist
            throughout the page even when you're scrolling.</li>
        <li>Using rem for font size means root em so it will only take that size into consideration regardless of parent
            attributes.</li>
        <li>You can use the float property for an image to be wrapped around in another elements like a paragraph for
            example.</li>
            <li>You can use clear for that paragraph to not appear either to the right of left of a floating image to give it its own line space.</li>
